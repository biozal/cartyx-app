/**
 * "You cannot reach this campaign" — either it does not exist, or the caller
 * is not at that table. A `subclass of Error`, so every existing caller (this
 * helper is shared by `calendars.ts`, `notes.ts`, `lore.ts`, `soundboard.ts`
 * and ~30 more, all of which `catch (e)` generically, report, and rethrow) is
 * completely unaffected: `instanceof Error` still holds, `.message` still
 * reads the same way, and the value still propagates identically. This is
 * additive information for the handlers that want it, not a behaviour change
 * for the ones that don't.
 *
 * The one handler that wants it today is `reportSoundboardError`
 * (`~/server/functions/soundboard.ts`). `loadBoardState`/`saveBoardState` take
 * a campaign id straight from the request, so ANY authenticated user can call
 * `loadBoardStateFn` in a loop with random 24-hex ids; every one of those
 * rejections used to file a GlitchTip exception, which makes error-report
 * volume against a shared single-node service an attacker-chosen number.
 * `packages.ts`'s `PackageClientError` defends the identical hazard on the
 * package side, and `soundboard.ts` already classified its own non-GM save
 * correctly — the "not a member at all" path, the only one reachable by
 * someone with no relationship to the campaign whatsoever, was the loud one.
 *
 * ONE MESSAGE for both the missing-campaign and the not-a-member case, on
 * purpose. Distinct messages ("Campaign not found" vs "Forbidden") are a
 * campaign-existence oracle: an outsider learns which of their guessed ids
 * name real campaigns purely from which error comes back. Collapsing them
 * costs a legitimate caller nothing — a member never sees either — and is the
 * same reason `getPackage` answers "not found" for a package that exists but
 * belongs to someone else.
