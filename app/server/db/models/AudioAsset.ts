  // `confirmOnceVariantUpload`'s success path and by nothing else. Rows
  // written before this field existed simply lack it; `getUserStorageUsage`
  // treats absent the same as null (see `audio-quota.ts`'s `$ifNull`
  // guard). The worker's terminal write for a successful once-attach
  // (`audio-worker/src/process.ts`) does not clear this alongside
  // `onceSourceKey` — the once-source object stays live and billed after a
  // successful attach, which is why this field exists: without it those
  // bytes were measured once for the `AUDIO_MAX_BYTES` gate and then never
  // recorded anywhere the storage quota could see.
  //
  // INVARIANT, load-bearing: this field must be reset to `null` at EVERY
  // site that clears or replaces `onceSourceKey` above, not only where it
  // is set. It describes the object the key points at, so once the key
  // stops pointing at that object, a standing byte count is a lie the
  // storage quota can't detect — it just silently over-counts, forever,
  // until (if ever) a future successful attach happens to overwrite it.
  // Task 3b's review caught exactly this: the field was added and wired
  // into the quota and the one write that SETS it, but not into the
  // sites that clear/replace the key. Every current site that writes
  // `onceSourceKey` also writes this field in the same `$set`:
  // `createOnceVariantUpload` (replace, -> null) and
  // `confirmOnceVariantUpload`'s reject path (clear, -> null) in
  // `app/server/functions/audio.ts`; `markOnceFailed` in
  // `audio-worker/src/process.ts` and `reapAbandonedOnceUploads` in
  // `audio-worker/src/claim.ts` (both clear, -> null). If `onceSourceKey`
  // ever grows a new writer, that writer owns this field too.
  onceSourceBytes: { type: Number, default: null },
  // When the CURRENT once-variant attach presigned its upload — the clock
  // `reapAbandonedOnceUploads` (audio-worker/src/claim.ts) measures a stuck
  // attach against. Cross-service contract field: written here, read only by
  // the worker.
  //
  // It exists because that reaper used to gate on `updatedAt`, and
  // `updatedAt` cannot answer the question it was being asked. "How long has
  // this attach been stuck?" is a JOB-LIVENESS question; `updatedAt` answers
  // "when was this document last modified at all", and unrelated writers
  // legitimately bump it. `updateAudioAsset` and `bulkTagAudioAssets` are
  // both unfenced facet edits — retitle the track, add a tag — so a GM who
  // edits an asset whose once-attach died mid-PUT pushes the reap out by the
  // full timeout, every time, and there is no self-service recovery:
  // `createOnceVariantUpload` requires `status: 'ready'` and the row is
  // stuck in `uploading`. Editing it again (or a bulk retag that happens to
  // include it) postpones it again, indefinitely. A dedicated field is
  // immune by construction. (The mirror-image case is `AudioPackage`'s
  // optimistic-concurrency precondition, which is CORRECTLY `updatedAt`:
  // there the question really is "has this document been modified since I
  // read it", so any writer bumping it should be a conflict.)
  //
  // INVARIANT, and it is what keeps this field cheap: it has EXACTLY ONE
  // writer, `createOnceVariantUpload` in `app/server/functions/audio.ts`,
  // which is also the only write in either package that can put a row into
  // `status: 'uploading', variant: 'once'` — the only state the reaper reads
  // it in. Nothing else may stamp it, and nothing needs to clear it: a value
  // left over from a finished attach is unreachable, because getting back
  // into the state that reads it necessarily runs the one writer again. If a
  // second path into `uploading`/`once` is ever added, that path owns this
  // field too.
  //
  // Rows written before this field existed lack it, and the reaper falls
  // back to `updatedAt` for exactly those (see its `$or`) — old rows keep
  // today's behaviour rather than being treated as infinitely stale, which
  // would reap every in-flight attach at deploy time.
  onceUploadStartedAt: { type: Date, default: null },
  // Which pipeline pass the row's CURRENT status/attempts/claim state
  // describes: 'main' for the ordinary source -> renditions pipeline (every
  // asset, including every one that predates this field), 'once' while a
  // Task 18 once-variant attach is queued/processing. The worker
  // (`processAsset`) reads this to pick its source object
  // (`sourceKey`/`onceSourceKey`) and its destination field
  // (`renditions`/`onceRenditions`) — "same pipeline, different
  // destination field," per the design doc's own framing.
  //
  // On EVERY terminal outcome of a once-variant run the worker resets this to
  // 'main' and flips `status` back to 'ready' — never `'failed'`. That is
  // three paths, not the two Task 18 closed: `markOnceFailed` covers the
  // permanent-error and budget-exhausted branches inside `processAsset`, and
  // `reapStale`'s own attempts-exhausted `updateMany` (audio-worker/src/
  // claim.ts) covers the case where the worker DIED rather than threw, so
  // `processAsset`'s catch never ran at all. That third path used to fall
  // through to the main pipeline's `failed`/`lastError` write and brick the
  // music asset exactly as described below.
  // This is a Task 18 review fix, not the original design: `status`:
  // 'failed'` describes the WHOLE row under this shared-state scheme, so a
  // failed once-variant used to be indistinguishable from a failed MAIN
  // asset, and a `PermanentError` (over-cap, silent, ...) on the once file
  // would set `permanentFailure: true` on what could be a perfectly good,
  // already-`ready` music asset — `retryAudioAsset` refuses those rows, so
  // there was no path back to `ready` short of delete-and-re-upload. See
  // `markOnceFailed` in audio-worker/src/process.ts and `onceLastError`
  // below. A once job is therefore never retried in place; the user just
  // attaches again, which is why `createOnceVariantUpload` resets
  // `attempts: 0` on every new attach rather than this field carrying retry
  // state across attempts.
  //
  // Reusing one status/attempts/claim state for a second job type is the
  // trade-off this collection's own design doc names explicitly — and
  // names as a STOP CONDITION, not a sanction: "if a second job type is
  // ever added this SHOULD BECOME a real queue rather than growing more
  // status enums." Task 18 is that second job type. The queue was reused
  // anyway, deliberately, to avoid building the real per-variant queue as
  // part of this task; the once-specific reap path
  // (`reapAbandonedOnceUploads` in audio-worker/src/claim.ts) and
  // `markOnceFailed` exist specifically to contain the two ways that reuse
  // was found to cause data loss (see Task 18's report, "Fix round 1"). The
  // remaining, accepted consequence: while a once-variant attach is
  // uploading/pending/processing, `status` no longer reads 'ready' for the
  // WHOLE row, so the main rendition — already finished, and never touched
  // by this job — is briefly reported as
  // uploading/pending/processing everywhere `status` is read (the board's
  // play gate, listAudioAssets, the library row). A genuine per-variant
  // queue (`onceStatus`/`onceAttempts`/...) is the real fix for that,
  // still out of scope here.
  //
  // "BRIEFLY" IS NOT THE WHOLE COST, and the exception is worth knowing
  // before anyone reads this consequence as cosmetic. On the GM's live
  // board the window is transient in Atlas but TERMINAL for that pad:
  // `useSoundboard`'s `loadAsset` THROWS for a pending/uploading/processing
  // asset, and `app/lib/soundboard/engine.ts`'s `ensureAsset` catches that
  // by adding the asset to its `unplayable` set — which nothing ever
  // clears for the engine's lifetime. So a GM who attaches a once-variant
  // to a track already loaded on a board loses that pad for the rest of the
  // session, even though the attach finishes seconds later and the main
  // renditions were never touched; only a reload (or a re-enable, which
  // builds a fresh engine) brings it back. It is not literally silent — the
  // pad renders "Failed to decode this rendition" via `onLoadError` — but
  // that reason is wrong, and it never goes away on its own. The same
  // per-variant queue fixes this; so, more cheaply, would clearing
  // `unplayable` when an asset is seen `ready` again.
