/**
 * The R2 key layout for audio, and the per-user namespace that makes it
 * owner-scoped.
 *
 * THE LAYOUT
 * ----------
 *   source:    uploads/audio/<prefix>/<timestamp>-<random>.<ext>
 *   rendition: uploads/audio/<prefix>/renditions/<assetId>.<opus|m4a>
 *
 * `<prefix>` is 32 lowercase hex characters (128 random bits) stored on the
 * User document as `audioStoragePrefix`. Everything a given user owns lives
 * under `uploads/audio/<prefix>/` and nothing else does.
 *
 * WHY A NAMESPACE AT ALL
 * ----------------------
 * The previous layout was flat — `uploads/audio/<timestamp>-<random>.<ext>` —
 * so a key carried no owner, and the only record of a source key was the asset
 * row itself. `deleteAudioAsset` deletes from R2 best-effort and drops the row
 * regardless, so a failed R2 delete destroyed the only reference to a live
 * object: nothing could ever name it again, and a bucket listing could not
 * attribute it to anyone, so it could not be reclaimed by any authority
 * narrower than "list the whole bucket". With this layout the listing itself
 * is the attribution.
 *
 * WHY RANDOM AND NOT THE OWNER ID
 * -------------------------------
 * The key IS the public URL: `publicUrl = ${cdnUrl}/${key}`, and the phase-2
 * board hands those URLs to players' browsers. A path segment containing the
 * owner's Mongo `_id` would mean anyone holding one shared track URL could
 * correlate every other track that user has ever published, and could probe
 * for them. 128 bits of `randomBytes` is not guessable and says nothing about
 * who owns it. The tradeoff is that the prefix must be STORED rather than
 * derived, which is what `resolveAudioStoragePrefix` below is for.
 *
 * An HMAC of the owner id under a server secret was the other candidate — no
 * storage, still unguessable. Rejected: it makes every object in the bucket
 * hostage to one secret. Rotating or losing `SESSION_SECRET`-style material
 * would silently re-point every user's namespace and strand the entire
 * library, with no record anywhere of where the old objects went. A stored
 * value can be read back; a derived one cannot be recovered.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES ON THE USER DOCUMENT
 * ---------------------------------
 * It is a property of the user, not of any one asset: every asset must land in
 * the same namespace or the listing stops being complete. Storing it per-asset
 * would make "the user's namespace" a thing you reconstruct from rows, which
 * is precisely the reconstruction this change exists to remove. A separate
 * collection would add a lookup and a second lifetime to keep in step with the
 * User's for no gain — the audio path already resolves the User document to
 * get the Mongo `_id` it scopes queries by.
