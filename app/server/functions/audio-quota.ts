/**
 * Per-user R2 storage usage, aggregated on demand rather than kept as a
 * denormalised counter on `User`.
 *
 * WHY ON DEMAND, NOT A COUNTER
 * -----------------------------
 * A counter needs a writer at every place bytes are added or removed:
 * `confirmAudioUpload` (source lands), `processAsset`'s success path
 * (renditions land), `deleteAudioAsset` (asset removed), and both the
 * worker's and the upload-side reapers (abandoned rows removed). Phase 2a's
 * adversarial review found correctness bugs in three of those exact
 * functions. A drifted quota either blocks a user who is actually under it
 * or admits one who is actually over — both are worse than the cost of this
 * query. One `$group` over one user's own assets, served by the existing
 * `{ownerId, createdAt}` index (an `ownerId`-only `$match` uses it as a
 * prefix), runs in the tens of milliseconds. That trade is deliberate: see
 * the phase 1.5 design doc.

/**
 * The byte-bearing fields on one `AudioAsset` row.
 *
 * This mirrors `audio-cleanup.ts`'s `referencedKeys`, one level down
 * (`.bytes` instead of `.key`), over the same six object slots — and, as of
 * `onceSourceBytes` landing on the schema, the same COUNT too:
 *
 * - `referencedKeys` enumerates six key fields: `sourceKey`, `onceSourceKey`,
 *   and the four rendition `.key` slots. This list enumerates their `.bytes`
 *   counterparts — `onceSourceKey`'s is `onceSourceBytes`, set by
 *   `confirmOnceVariantUpload`'s success write, the once-variant analogue of
 *   `sourceBytes`/`confirmAudioUpload`.
 * - Rows written before `onceSourceBytes` existed simply lack the field; the
 *   `$ifNull` guard below treats that the same as any other unconfirmed slot
 *   and contributes 0, not `null`/`NaN`. No migration needed.
 * - The two lists still name different leaf fields (`.key` vs `.bytes`), so a
 *   single shared array can't drive both without adding structure whose only
 *   real consumer is a six-line list. Copied instead, deliberately, with this
 *   comment as the cross-reference: if `AudioAsset` ever grows a new
 *   rendition slot or source field, add its `.key` path to `referencedKeys`
 *   in `audio-cleanup.ts` AND its `.bytes` path here.

/**
 * Sum of every byte-bearing field across every asset a user owns, plus how
 * many asset rows contributed.
 *
 * Counts EVERY status, not just `ready` — an asset sitting in `pending` or
 * `processing` already occupies real R2 bytes (its source object, confirmed
 * by `confirmAudioUpload`'s `HeadObject` before the row ever reaches
 * `pending`), and counting only `ready` would let a user park unbounded
 * bytes there indefinitely.
 *
 * `$ifNull` guards every addend: a field that is `null` (never confirmed, or
 * a rendition slot never produced) or entirely absent (a rendition
 * sub-document that was never set — the schema's `default: undefined`) would
 * otherwise make Mongo's `$add` evaluate the WHOLE sum to `null` for that
 * document, not just that one term. Falling back to `0` per-field is what
 * makes an unconfirmed asset contribute `0` rather than poisoning the total.
 *
 * `userId` — the Mongo `_id`, and the ONLY value that may scope this query —
 * is cast to a real `ObjectId` before the pipeline runs. Unlike `.find()`,
 * `.aggregate()` sends its pipeline straight to MongoDB without Mongoose's
 * query-time casting, so a bare string here would silently match nothing
 * (see `tabletop.ts`'s `$expr` comment for the same rule applied to a
 * different aggregation-context query).
