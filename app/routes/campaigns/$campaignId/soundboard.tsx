 * The in-campaign GM board — the surface everything else in this phase feeds.
 *
 * This outer component owns every query and NOTHING else. `useSoundboard` and
 * the board controls live in `BoardSurface` below, which is `key`ed so that
 * clearing the board genuinely unmounts it — see `boardGeneration`.
 *
 * The four query results and where each goes:
 *
 * 1. **`loadBoardStateFn` → `initialState`** — the hydrate seam. The hook
 *    applies it directly instead of replaying commands: a replay of `setMood`
 *    + per-item `play` cannot express an item the mood names but the GM had
 *    STOPPED (`setMood` resolves it back to playing), and a replay would also
 *    re-save what it just read, making "opened the board" the last write to
 *    `updatedBy`. Forgetting this key is the SILENT failure — the hook cannot
 *    tell "forgot" from "this board does not hydrate", so the board would
 *    never restore and the `[pkg]` effect's `loadPackage` would overwrite the
 *    persisted board with a blank one, logging nothing anywhere.
 * 2. **`getPackageFn` → `pkg` + `packagePending`** — passing `packagePending:
 *    false` while the query is still running concludes hydration against
 *    `pkg === null`; the `[pkg]` effect then arms a prompt-urgency write of a
 *    blank board and DURABLY destroys the persisted `moodId` and every item's
 *    `playing`/`volume`.
 * 3. **`listPackageAssetsFn` → `assets`** — Task 21's package-scoped read,
 *    never `listAudioAssetsFn`. The library list is owner-scoped and
 *    cursor-paginated at 50 while a package holds up to 64 items; the engine
 *    caches a failed load as unplayable for its whole lifetime, so a package
 *    straddling that boundary gets permanently dead pads.
 * 4. **`getCampaignFn` → `persist`** — see `BoardSurface`, which refuses to
 *    render any dispatching control until this one has settled.

            defaults to "not the GM", so a command issued while the campaign
            query is in flight is silently never persisted — and if that query
            fails outright, the board would never save for the entire session
            with `saveError` left `null`. Failing visibly here is the whole
            point; that class of silence is what this surface exists to remove.

            `&& !campaign` is the load-bearing half. TanStack Query v5 keeps
            `data` and sets `status: 'error'` when a BACKGROUND refetch fails
            (`query-core`'s `onError` leaves `data` alone), and this query runs
            with the default `refetchOnWindowFocus` at `staleTime: 0` — so a GM
            alt-tabbing back during a network blip is the ordinary trigger.
            Branching on the error alone unmounts `BoardSurface`, disposing the
            `AudioContext` and stopping every sound mid-session. That is the
            design's governing rule inverted: "audio is never interrupted by a
            persistence or network failure. The engine owns sound; the server is
            a mirror." A stale-but-present campaign answers the only question
            this gate asks (is this caller the GM), so the board plays on and
            the failure is a notice, not a teardown. */}
