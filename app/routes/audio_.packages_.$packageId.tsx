// FILENAME: `audio_.packages_.$packageId.tsx` — TWO trailing underscores,
// not one. This needed re-verifying empirically rather than copying Task
// 13's `audio_.` convention directly, and the first attempt (`audio_.packages.
// $packageId.tsx`, matching Task 13's report verbatim) was itself wrong:
//
// 1. A single underscore on `audio_` only opts this route out of nesting
//    under `~/routes/audio.tsx` (the flat audio library page) — the exact
//    hazard Task 13's report describes. It does NOT opt out of nesting under
//    `~/routes/audio_.packages.tsx` (Task 13's OWN route file), because
//    TanStack Router's flat-file convention nests a route under the LONGEST
//    matching prefix that has its own route file, and `audio_.packages` is
//    exactly that prefix here (it's Task 13's route id verbatim). Built
//    `audio_.packages.$packageId.tsx`, ran `npx vite build` (regenerates
//    `routeTree.gen.ts` — see Task 13's report on why `npm run typecheck`
//    alone does not), and confirmed: `AudioPackagesPackageIdRoute`'s
//    `getParentRoute: () => AudioPackagesRoute` (Task 13's list route, NOT
//    root), and `AudioPackagesRoute` itself flipped to
//    `AudioPackagesRouteWithChildren`. `PackagesListPage` (Task 13's
//    component) renders no `<Outlet />` anywhere in its JSX — it's a
//    complete, self-contained page — so nesting a child under it silently
//    turns it into exactly the kind of Outlet-less layout Task 13's report
//    warned `audio.tsx` would become: navigating to `/audio/packages/<id>`
//    would match this child route but never actually render
//    `PackageEditorPage`, because nothing in the matched tree above it
//    delegates rendering to a child.
//
// 2. The fix is a SECOND trailing underscore, on the `packages` segment too:
//    `packages_`. With both `audio_.packages_.$packageId.tsx`, no existing
//    route file's id is a prefix of `audio_.packages_` (there is no
//    `audio_.tsx`, and `audio_.packages_` itself doesn't match Task 13's
//    `audio_.packages` id — the trailing underscore makes them different
//    strings), so nothing nests. Rebuilt and confirmed:
//    `AudioPackagesPackageIdRoute`'s `getParentRoute: () => rootRouteImport`
//    (not `AudioPackagesRoute`), `path: '/audio/packages/$packageId'` (the
//    URL — unaffected; both underscores are stripped from the rendered path,
//    same as Task 13's single one, only the internal id keeps them:
//    `/audio_/packages_/$packageId`), and `AudioPackagesRoute` reverted to a
//    plain `typeof AudioPackagesRoute` — no `WithChildren`, no children
//    array. `git diff --stat app/routes/audio_.packages.tsx` is empty: that
//    route was never touched by this file's existence.
//
// One correction to Task 13's report: it claims `createFileRoute`'s string
// argument "keys off the rendered FULL PATH... does not encode the
// filename's underscore" — but Task 13's OWN committed file uses
// `createFileRoute('/audio_/packages')` (the underscored id form), not
// `/audio/packages`. I wrote this file's literal as `/audio/packages/
// $packageId` (full path, no underscores) first; `npx vite build`'s route
// generator rewrote it back to the id form
// (`/audio_/packages_/$packageId`) on disk, unprompted, exactly mirroring
// Task 13's file. That's the tool's own canonical form for a route whose id
// and full path differ — matching it here rather than fighting the
// generator on every future build.
