/**
 * The per-account request budgets for the audio ingest and soundboard-package
 * surface, plus the one message helper the wrappers format their refusals
 * with.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS SEPARATELY: the buckets are consumed from BOTH
 * `~/utils/audio-server-fns.ts` and `~/utils/soundboard-server-fns.ts`, and a
 * limiter is only a limiter if both wrappers share ONE instance of it — a
 * bucket created per-module would silently double every budget the day a
 * third wrapper appears. It lives under `app/lib/` because both of those
 * wrapper modules are client-bundled: this file may therefore import nothing
 * but `~/lib/rate-limit` (itself import-free). Adding any dependency here
 * that reaches mongoose or `@sentry/node` breaks `npm run build`, not
 * `typecheck`/`lint`/`test` — see `~/utils/require-actor.ts`'s doc comment
 * for the exact mechanism.
 *
 * WHERE THEY ARE APPLIED: in the wrapper layer, immediately after
 * `requireActor()`, keyed on the caller's Mongo `_id`. The key is an ACCOUNT
 * rather than an IP, which is the deliberate part — rotating IPs buys an
 * abuser nothing, and a household behind one NAT is not one bucket.
 *
 * WHAT THAT PLACEMENT DOES NOT BUY, corrected in the final whole-branch
 * review: it does NOT mean "a function added later cannot silently skip the
 * gate", which is what this comment (and `~/utils/audio-server-fns.ts`'s)
 * used to claim. A gate in the wrapper layer only covers callers that come
 * through the wrapper layer, and a SECOND ingest adapter already does not:
 * the phase-3 REST routes (`app/routes/api/audio/uploads.ts` and
 * `uploads.$id.confirm.ts`) call `createAudioUpload`/`confirmAudioUpload` in
 * `~/server/functions/audio.ts` directly. The storage quota and the
 * pending-job cap DO cover them, because those checks live inside `audio.ts`
 * itself; only these buckets are bypassed. That is unreachable today —
 * `resolveApiUser` 401s every request — but phase 3 is precisely the phase
 * that turns that adapter on, and it will need its own key for these buckets
 * (the bearer token's resolved user id) rather than inheriting one. The rule
 * that follows: anything that must be bounded for BOTH adapters belongs
 * beside the quota/cap checks inside `audio.ts`, not here.
 *
 * SCOPE: these buckets are in-process (see `~/lib/rate-limit`'s own scope
 * note). The web pod runs `replicaCount: 1`, so per-process is the whole
 * picture today; at N>1 replicas every number below becomes per-replica.
 *
 * NO BUCKET ON READS — `listPackages`, `getPackage`, `listPackageAssets`,
 * `listAudioAssets`, `loadBoardState`. Per the design: they are bounded by
 * their projections and by the `$in` over a package's <=64 items, and a read
 * bound risks breaking a legitimate board reload (opening a campaign fires
 * several of these at once, and a refused one leaves a half-loaded board).
 * `getAudioStorageUsage` is the one deliberate exception — see
 * `storageUsageReadLimiter` below for why the argument above does not cover
 * it. (This paragraph used to sit on `rateLimitMessage`'s JSDoc at the
 * bottom of the file, where it rendered as the hover tooltip for a string
 * formatter; it is module policy, so it lives with the module.)
 *
 * `audioIngestLimiter`'s two numbers are env-overridable (below); the other
 * six buckets stay hardcoded — see that limiter's own comment for why it
 * alone gets this treatment.
 *
 * WHY A PLAIN `process.env` READ BELOW DOES NOT CONTRADICT "THIS MODULE IS
 * CLIENT-BUNDLED" ABOVE: this module IS in the client's static import graph
 * — both wrapper files import it at the top level — but every reference to
 * its exports, in both wrappers, lives inside a `.handler()` body, which
 * TanStack Start strips before the client build runs. Once every reference
 * is gone, Rollup drops the now-unused import, and with no other consumer
 * anywhere in `app/` (checked: `grep -rl "audio-rate-limits" app` returns
 * only these two files), the whole module — including any `process.env`
 * read inside it — never reaches the browser. Verified empirically for
 * `AUDIO_INGEST_RATE_LIMIT_CAPACITY`: after `npm run build`, zero
 * occurrences anywhere under `.output/public`, with `mongoose` (163 hits
 * under `.output/server`, 0 under `.output/public`) and `rateLimitMessage`'s
 * unmangled `requests. Try again in ` template-literal fragment as controls
 * proving the search was meaningful rather than searching an empty place.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT THIS DEPENDS ON, STATED PLAINLY, because nothing mechanical
 * enforces it: every reference to anything exported from this file — in
 * EVERY consumer, not just the two that exist today — must stay inside a
 * `.handler()` body. Break that once (a route or component statically
 * imports `audioIngestLimiter`, say, to show a caller their remaining
 * budget) and this module ships to the browser. It would not fail loudly:
 * `process.env[name]` is a COMPUTED member access, which Vite's `define`
 * text-replacement cannot match (it only rewrites literal
 * `process.env.SOME_NAME` property reads), so the failure mode is not a
 * baked-in value — it's `process` being undefined at module-evaluation time,
 * i.e. a `ReferenceError` thrown the instant that chunk loads in every
 * browser. `typecheck`/`lint`/`test` all stay green, and `npm run build`
 * would SUCCEED too, because this is a runtime crash, not a build error —
 * the same "nothing mechanically enforces that" gap
 * `~/utils/require-actor.ts`'s doc comment already names for the identical
 * hazard on the dynamic-import side of this codebase. Keep every future
 * usage of this module's exports inside a handler.
 *
 * And never a `VITE_PUBLIC_*` name regardless of where it's referenced from
 * — that bakes the limit into the browser image on purpose, which defeats
 * the entire point of making it operator-tunable.

/**
 * Guards a `process.env` read the same way

 * misconfiguration, not a deliberate zero-capacity limiter.
 *
 * Read once, at module load (this module's constants are built at import
 * time, same as the hardcoded buckets below) — not re-read per request like
 * the two functions above, because a token bucket's state must persist
 * across requests and there is nothing to re-read INTO once constructed.
 * Changing the env value therefore takes effect on the next pod restart, the

 * `helm upgrade` that changes a plain Deployment env value triggers that
 * restart on its own — no checksum annotation needed, unlike a Secret).

/**
 * Ingest: `createAudioUpload`, `confirmAudioUpload`, both once-variant
 * halves, and `retryAudioAsset`. The design's "tight" row, and the one that
 * matters most — every confirm enqueues transcode work on a single-replica
 * worker with a global FIFO claim, so this is the queue-starvation lever.
 * `retryAudioAsset` is on this bucket too: it makes a `failed` row claimable
 * again, which is the same act as a confirm under a different verb.
 *
 * Capacity 60 — the legitimate burst is a multi-file dropzone drop, which
 * costs TWO calls per file (presign + confirm; `AudioUploadDropzone` runs
 * them sequentially, one file at a time). 60 tokens absorbs a 30-file drop
 * with the bucket starting full, comfortably over the 20-file drop the plan
 * names as legitimate, and still cuts a scripted flood of 200 confirms in a
 * second down to 60.
 *
 * Refill 1/s — one call every second sustained, i.e. one FILE every two
 * seconds once the burst budget is spent. A GM importing a 100-file SFX
 * library gets the first 30 files at full speed and the rest at ~2 s each
 * (~3 minutes), which is slower than the upload itself only for tiny files.
 * An abuser gets 3,600 calls an hour instead of the tens of thousands a
 * tight loop would otherwise manage — and the storage quota (task 4) and
 * per-user pending-job cap (task 5) bound what those calls can actually
 * consume.
 *
 * `AUDIO_INGEST_RATE_LIMIT_CAPACITY` / `AUDIO_INGEST_RATE_LIMIT_REFILL_PER_SEC`,
 * both env-overridable with the 60 / 1 above retained as defaults — this is
 * the ONE bucket of the five in this file wired to the Helm chart (Task 11),
 * because it is the one this module's own comments already single out as
 * "the queue-starvation lever" and the design doc's open-questions table
 * flags default rate-limit values generally as something to "tune after real
 * usage." The other six buckets stay hardcoded: nothing has called out
 * `packageWriteLimiter`/`boardStateLimiter`/`libraryMutationLimiter`/
 * `orphanCleanupLimiter`/`packageEditLimiter`/`storageUsageReadLimiter` as
 * needing operational tuning, and wiring seven buckets' worth of env
 * plumbing on spec would be scope beyond what Task 11 asked for. The mechanism below (a plain `process.env` read, module-scope)
 * extends to any of them identically if that need ever arises — see the
 * module comment above (`envPositiveNumber`'s guard, and the invariant that
 * keeps this safe) before doing so.

/**
 * Library mutations: `deleteAudioAsset`, `updateAudioAsset`, and
 * `bulkTagAudioAssets`. Not in the design's table; added after review found
 * the original in-code justification for leaving them ungated was factually
 * wrong on both counts.
 *
 * `deleteAudioAsset` **does** spend R2 — up to six `DeleteObjectCommand`
 * calls per request (source, both renditions, and the three once-variant
 * objects). And both it and `updateAudioAsset` throw on a caller-supplied id
 * that misses `findOne({ _id, ownerId })`, which any authenticated user can
 * trigger by generating well-formed ObjectIds against a schema of
 * `z.object({ id: objectId })`. That throw is now an `AudioClientError` (see
 * `~/server/functions/audio.ts`), which closes the GlitchTip-amplification
 * half at its source; this bucket bounds the R2 spend and the write volume
 * that the type change does not touch.
 *
 * Capacity 60 — generous on purpose, because clearing out or re-tagging a
 * library is a genuine session-length activity. The UI drives both one asset
 * at a time (a confirm dialog per delete, a modal save per edit — there is no
 * bulk-delete endpoint), so 60 covers a user disposing of or editing sixty
 * assets in one sitting without ever meeting the limiter.
 *
 * Refill 0.5/s — one every two seconds, deliberately slower than the ingest
 * bucket's. A human clicking through a confirm dialog per asset cannot
 * sustain much more than that, while a scripted loop drops from thousands per
 * second to one per two seconds.
 *
 * `bulkTagAudioAssets` IS on this bucket, reversing an earlier ruling that
 * left it open. That ruling was not wrong about what it said — the function
 * really does have no not-found throw and no capture path, and its `ids`
 * array really is bounded by `.max(200)` in the schema — it was wrong about
 * what it left out. Both sentences are about TELEMETRY volume and request
 * SHAPE; neither is about write volume, which is the axis this bucket's two
 * other members are here for.
 *
 * On that axis it is the largest write on the surface: one call is an
 * `updateMany` over 200 `_id`s with a `$set` of four fields plus `$addToSet`
 * of up to 30 tags, against the multikey `{ownerId, tags}` index — on the
 * order of 6,000 index entries per request, versus ONE row for
 * `updateAudioAsset`, which has been gated all along. That is the same
 * argument `packageEditLimiter` was added on ("the bigger write cannot be the
 * one left open"), applied one endpoint over. `.max(200)` bounds the size of
 * a single call and says nothing about how many calls there may be, which is
 * the parameter the caller controls.
 *
 * Sharing the bucket rather than minting an eighth: all three are library
 * housekeeping reached from the same page in the same sitting, so one budget
 * across them is the honest model — and a bulk retag is meant to REPLACE a
 * run of single edits, not to be spent alongside a full allowance of them.

 * the ingest bucket — the table names endpoint GROUPS, and the placement
 * rationale it states ("no server function added later can silently skip it")
 * argues for covering the surface rather than the list.
 *
 * This is the tightest of the seven buckets in this file, because these two
 * are the only endpoints on the surface where a single call has an unbounded
 * EXTERNAL cost. Both run `findOrphans`, which pages an R2 `ListObjectsV2` over the
 * caller's prefix up to `AUDIO_ORPHAN_SCAN_MAX_KEYS` (10,000) — up to ten
 * Class-A operations per call — and both fire an un-awaited
 * `serverCaptureEvent` (`audio_orphan_scan` / `audio_orphan_delete`) on every
 * success. Ungated, a loop makes both R2 spend and Umami event volume an
 * attacker-controlled parameter; the second is the same telemetry-
 * amplification shape 2a's review found twice.
 *
 * Capacity 10 — orphan cleanup is an operator-cadence action, not a user-loop
 * one. `/audio` drives it from two explicit buttons: one scan, then one
 * batched delete for the whole selection (the key list is a single
 * `.max()`ed array, not a call per key). A whole session is
 * scan -> delete -> re-scan to verify, i.e. three calls; 10 covers three such
 * cycles back to back.
 *
 * Refill 1/30s — one call every thirty seconds sustained. That is far above
 * any human's cleanup cadence (nothing about the result changes within thirty
 * seconds) and caps the sustained cost at ~120 scans/hour rather than
 * thousands.

 * Package edits: `updatePackageFn` only. Added in the final whole-branch

 * was made on footprint alone — true as far as it goes (an update cannot
 * grow the user's footprint; the schema's `.max()`ed arrays bound the
 * document) — but footprint is not the only cost this surface bounds:
 *
 *  - EVERY call is a whole-document `$set` of `items` AND `moods`, up to
 *    ~410 KiB. That is the largest single write anywhere on this surface,
 *    several hundred times a `saveBoardState` — and `saveBoardState` IS
 *    gated (`boardStateLimiter`, 40/2), specifically because the design
 *    names "amplify Atlas writes" as a threat. The bigger write cannot be
 *    the one left open.
 *  - Every success fires an un-awaited `serverCaptureEvent('package_updated')`
 *    — one Umami event per call, at caller-controlled volume. That is the
 *    exact telemetry-amplification class that got `scanOrphanAudio`/
 *    `deleteOrphanAudio` gated mid-phase.
 *
 * And Task 7's optimistic-concurrency fence does NOT bound either of those:
 * `PackageStaleWriteError` carries `currentUpdatedAt`, so a script simply
 * replays with the value the refusal handed it and every iteration succeeds.
 *
 * Capacity 30 — this is a human-click endpoint: one explicit "Save changes"
 * press per call, each preceded by an edit and followed by a round trip.
 * Thirty back-to-back saves is far past any real editing session. It must
 * also clear the two-saves-in-a-row case comfortably (the editor re-seeds
 * its draft from the save's own response, so a second Save immediately
 * after the first is a legitimate, and now token-costing, action), and 30
 * does that with 28 to spare.
 *
 * Refill 0.5/s — one every two seconds, deliberately the same rate as
 * `libraryMutationLimiter` and for the same reason: a human editing and
 * saving cannot sustain more, while a scripted replay loop drops from
 * thousands per second to one per two seconds.
 *
 * NOT shared with `libraryMutationLimiter` despite the matching refill: that
 * bucket bounds asset deletes/edits, and sharing would let a library-cleanup
 * session consume a package-editing session's budget for no gain — they are
 * different resources reached from different pages.
 *
 * `deletePackageFn` stays UNGATED, and unlike the old blanket sentence about
 * "update and delete" this reason is actually true of delete: it is a single
 * `deleteOne` by `{_id, ownerId}` (no document body at all, so nothing to
 * amplify by size), and its `package_deleted` event fires only when a row
 * really was removed — a replay against the same id hits `deletedCount: 0`
 * and throws `PackageClientError`, which files nothing. Its event volume is
 * therefore bounded by how many packages the caller owns, and the only ways
 * to get more are `createPackage`/`clonePackage`, both on
 * `packageWriteLimiter` behind a 100-package cap.

 * The justification it replaces said this read was safe because "its cost
 * scales with the caller's own asset count, not with how often they call
 * it." That is the wrong axis: total Atlas CPU is count TIMES frequency, and
 * frequency is exactly the parameter a caller controls. It also happens to
 * be the only read on this surface that is an `$group` AGGREGATION rather
 * than a projected `find` over an indexed filter, so it is the one where

 *
 * Why a bucket here does not run into the reason the other reads have none:
 * that reason is "a refused read leaves a half-loaded board." This read
 * feeds ONE indicator — `AudioQuotaBar` on `/audio`, which takes an explicit
 * `error` prop and renders a message in place of the bar. Nothing else on
