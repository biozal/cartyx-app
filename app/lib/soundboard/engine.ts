   * total — while the browser still held the buffer, because the source node
   * keeps its own reference to it.
   *
   * Nothing went silent (that reference is exactly why), so this was never

   * WHY A SCHEDULED TIME AND NOT AN `onended` COUNTER, which is the obvious
   * alternative and was the first attempt. `onended` is an EVENT: it fires

   * whenever it is asked, with no dependence on event delivery. A fade of 0
   * (the ordinary stop) therefore releases immediately, as it should — the

   *
