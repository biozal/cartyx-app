/**
 * Classifies failures for the backend circuit breaker and retry policy.
 *
 * Only *infrastructure* failures (the network or the server process is
 * unhealthy) count toward tripping the breaker and are worth retrying.
 * Application errors thrown by server-fn code (validation, not-found, auth)
 * cannot heal on retry and must never trip the breaker.
 *
 * Server-fn errors cross the wire as plain `Error`s: TanStack Start's
 * serialization (seroval) does NOT preserve own props on `Error` instances,
 * so a handler throwing `Object.assign(new Error(...), { status: 503 })`
 * arrives client-side with only `name`/`message` — `status` is gone.
 * Classification of server-thrown failures therefore relies entirely on
 * message patterns below; the `status >= 500` branch only ever fires for
 * errors constructed client-side (e.g. from a fetch Response), never for
 * ones that came back through a server function.

/**
 * Message patterns for infrastructure failures that can arrive as plain
 * `Error`s — i.e. without a `status` we can check — because they crossed a
 * boundary that discards it:
 *  - the TanStack start-client-core server-fn fetcher deserializes a 500 into
 *    a plain rethrown Error, and a non-serialized proxy/platform response
 *    (nginx/ALB/Cloudflare) arrives as `new Error(await response.text())`;
 *  - a deploy in progress can make the client reference a server-fn manifest
 *    entry that no longer exists on the new deployment;
 *  - the Mongo driver can throw mid-query on a disconnect without the
 *    server-fn layer having a chance to tag `status` on it;
 *  - our own DB-layer guards (health.ts, oauth.ts upsertUser) throw
 *    "database not connected" messages when the connection is down.
 *  - a mid-session Mongo disconnect surfaces as mongoose command-buffering
 *    timeouts, driver `MongoNetworkError`/`PoolClearedError` drops, or
 *    "MongoClient must be connected" guard messages (kept for clients still
 *    running a bundle from before the move to the graph);
 *  - a graph or CQL request that failed at the transport ("Graph request
 *    failed", "CQL request failed"). A graph *conflict* is a lost race, not an
 *    outage, and is deliberately not matched;
 *  - Vercel's platform-level failures (as opposed to our own handler code)
 *    arrive as `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`/`FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT`
 *    error bodies. The generic "A server error has occurred" text Vercel
 *    pairs with those codes is deliberately NOT matched on its own — it's
 *    too generic and would false-positive on unrelated app copy.
