/**
 * E2E: the shared-vs-private proof for the wiki card overflow menu.
 *
 * The entire point of the overflow menu's two display actions is a split that
 * NO unit test can prove — it needs two independent browsers driven by two
 * DIFFERENT users:
 *
 *  - "Push to Tabletop" (GM only) is SHARED. It writes a window onto the
 *    campaign's TabletopScreen document, which every member of the campaign
 *    reads. A PLAYER, in their own browser, therefore sees it too.
 *  - "Show on Tab" is PRIVATE. It writes a window onto the CALLER's own
 *    tabletop player-state, which is per-user and never shared — so another
 *    user never sees it, and it survives a reload for its owner.
 *
 * We drive with Quests because `QuestWindow` carries a stable
 * `data-testid="quest-window"` — `FloatingWindow` and `CharacterWindow` have
 * none. The overflow trigger is aria-labelled "Quest actions" and the menu
 * items are `overflow-item-push` / `overflow-item-show-on-tab`.
 *
 * TWO USERS, NOT TWO GM TABS. The task brief suggested two GM contexts, but a
 * private window is keyed by user, so two contexts of the SAME GM cannot tell
 * shared from private (a reloaded second GM tab would see BOTH — the shared
 * screen window AND that same GM's own private window). To actually prove the
 * split we mint a real PLAYER session for a seeded player-member of the
 * campaign, entirely in-spec, following the JWT shape in `e2e/globalSetup.ts`
 * (no globalSetup change, no production code path). The player is a genuine
 * non-GM campaign member (role resolved from `campaign.members`).
 *
 * WHY THE OBSERVER RELOADS. Opening a tabletop window is persisted but is NOT
 * broadcast to other connected clients — no client ever emits the `window:show`
 * message (the realtime service is a pure relay and the send side was never
 * wired; the same is true of drag-and-drop). So a second browser converges only
 * on its next fetch. We reload the player to force that fetch. This proves the
 * SHARING SEMANTIC (push → shared surface, visible to another user); it does
 * NOT exercise live propagation, which does not currently work end-to-end. See
 * the task report for that finding.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT `blockPartyKit` (which would abort ws://localhost:1999
 * and add noise); `npm run dev` — the Playwright webServer — runs the realtime
 * service, so leaving it up is harmless and realistic.
 *
 * Pre-conditions: seeded dev DB (`npm run dev:seed`) and the full dev stack
 * (web + realtime) on :3000 / :1999. This spec self-seeds its own quest.
