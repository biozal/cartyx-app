/**
 * Recover rows whose worker died mid-job. Under the attempt cap they go back to

 * full stale timeout, so no further backoff is warranted, and clearing it stops
 * a stale future value left by an earlier `requeueForRetry` from parking the
 * row a second time.
 *
 * `uploadTimeoutMs` handles the *other* stuck state: a row stays
 * `status: 'uploading'` from the moment `createAudioUpload` presigns until
 * `confirmAudioUpload` flips it to `pending`, and nothing else ever writes it.
 * A browser that dies between those two steps — or a PUT that fails, which
 * `uploadAudioFile` correctly refuses to confirm — leaves the row there
 * forever: an animated spinner in the UI that never resolves, a `/audio` route
 * that polls every 4s forever, and a `sourceKey` the orphan scanner treats as
 * in-use. Presigned URLs expire in 300s, so a row older than this cap is
 * definitively abandoned and is failed with an honest message, which stops the
 * poll.
 *
 * That reap also DELETES the abandoned R2 object, and it has to. The previous
 * version of this comment claimed the reap "lets delete/orphan-scan reclaim
 * it", which was false by construction: `collectInUseKeys`
 * (app/server/functions/cleanup.ts) has no status filter, so the failed row
 * goes on advertising its `sourceKey` as in-use forever and no orphan scan can
 * ever reclaim the object. Deleting here loses nothing — the object never
 * passed `confirmAudioUpload`, so it was never accepted as a source in the
 * first place.
 *
 * The delete is BEST EFFORT and runs AFTER the status write: an R2 outage must
 * not keep a user's spinner alive, so a failed delete is logged and reported,
 * not thrown. It is also skipped when the fenced write matched nothing, which
 * is how a confirm landing between the read and the write keeps its object.
 *
 * That upload reap is BOUNDED — `REAP_UPLOAD_BATCH` rows per pass, a `beat()`
 * per row, batched deletes, and `shouldContinue` honoured between rows. It was
 * none of those things, and the result was a denial of service any authenticated
 * user could trigger; see `REAP_UPLOAD_BATCH`.
 *
 * **Task 18 review Critical 1.** `reapAbandonedUploads` below now EXCLUDES
 * `variant: 'once'` rows and a SIBLING reaper
 * (`reapAbandonedOnceUploads`) handles them instead, on `updatedAt` rather
 * than `createdAt`. The distinction is the entire fix, so it is worth
 * spelling out why sharing the first reaper was actively dangerous:
 * `createOnceVariantUpload` flips an EXISTING, potentially long-lived row to
 * `status: 'uploading'` to attach a once-variant. That row's `createdAt` is
 * whenever the MAIN asset was first uploaded — routinely hours or days in
 * the past. Filtering abandoned-upload candidates on `createdAt` therefore
 * matched every such row on the very next reap pass (this loop's default
 * poll interval is seconds), while the browser's PUT to the once-variant's
 * presigned URL was still in flight. The reaper then failed the row and
 * pushed its `sourceKey` — the MAIN asset's source, not the once-variant's —
 * into a real `DeleteObjects` call. The renditions survive untouched, which
 * is what makes it silent: the asset keeps playing right up until someone
 * needs to re-transcode it, at which point the source is already gone.
 *
 * That sibling gates on `onceUploadStartedAt`, a field whose sole writer is
 * `createOnceVariantUpload`, so it reads "how long has THIS attach been
 * stuck" instead of "how old is the row." It originally used `updatedAt`,
 * which was better than `createdAt` but still wrong for the same underlying
 * reason: `updatedAt` records modification, not progress, and the app's two
 * unfenced facet editors reset it — see that function's own `$or` for the
 * whole argument.

 * upload in the window between reading the candidate list and writing the
 * failure; the write is fenced on `status: 'uploading'` so it correctly no-ops
 * for that row, and only a matched write authorizes deleting the object. A bulk
 * update cannot report which rows it moved, so pairing it with a delete loop
 * would destroy the source of a freshly confirmed asset.
 *
 * The DELETES are batched anyway, because that authorization is per row but the
 * R2 call is not: keys are collected as each fenced write matches and handed to
 * `deleteSource` in chunks, so 200 rows cost 200 Atlas round trips and ONE R2
 * request rather than 400 round trips.
 *

 * legitimately run for seconds without touching a pipeline stage, and a stale
 * heartbeat here gets a perfectly healthy pod killed mid-reap — which is how
 * the backlog became self-sustaining.

 * clause, a once-variant attach (which flips an EXISTING, long-lived row to
 * `status: 'uploading'`) matches on `createdAt` alone — that row's
 * `createdAt` is the MAIN asset's original upload time, not when the attach
 * started, so every once-attach older than `uploadTimeoutMs` (i.e.
 * essentially all of them) was abandoned-reaped within one poll interval of
 * starting, deleting the MAIN source object. `reapAbandonedOnceUploads`
 * below handles once-attaches instead, gated on `updatedAt`. `$ne` (not
 * `!= 'once'`) so rows written before this field existed — where `variant`
