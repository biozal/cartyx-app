 * `MAX_SOURCE_DURATION_MS`'s comment there before touching anything below — it
 * states the invariant and enumerates the six different "durations" this
 * feature has managed to confuse.
 *
 * THERE IS NO HEADER PRE-GATE, and that is a decision rather than an omission.
 * The tempting shape is "reject when `format=duration` claims something absurd,
 * several times the cap — over-reports only inflate, so it cannot false-
 * positive". The asymmetry does not survive measurement. ffmpeg extrapolates an
 * MP3's duration from the FIRST FRAME's bitrate, so the over-report factor is
 * `avg_bitrate / first_frame_bitrate` and does not depend on the file's length
 * at all. Measured here on files built entirely by stock ffmpeg:
 *
 *   honest 20.8-minute MP3, 32 kbit/s intro frame + 320 kbit/s body (48 MB,
 *   inside AUDIO_MAX_BYTES, inside the 30-minute cap)   claims 12 464 s = 6.9x cap
 *   the hostile gap-timeline Matroska this bound exists for     4 000 s = 2.2x cap
 *
 * Any threshold low enough to catch the hostile file permanently rejects the
 * honest one, which is round 5's defect exactly. And the gate buys nothing now:
 * the reason a header gate ever looked necessary was the COST of decoding an
 * unbounded source, and `boundedDecodeFilters` caps that at ~1 s (measured 0.99 s
 * on a 13.9-hour, 50 MB source). A gate that cannot be made safe and is not
 * needed is not worth having. `probe()`'s duration stays for provenance and for
 * the disagreement log below, and rejects nothing.

 *
 * The predecessor of this function compared against `probe()`'s HEADER duration

 * an extrapolation for a VBR MP3 with no Xing header, a 1-second quiet intro
 * over-reports a 60 s file as 145 s (measured), and 25% does not cover a 143%

 * How far a rendition may run PAST the recorded duration: 250 ms.
 *
 * The check used to have no such side, and the comment above used to end "the
 * check is still ONE-SIDED: padding can only make a rendition longer" — which
 * is true about padding and false about the failure this guard exists for.
 * Round 6's actual defect was a `ready` row recording 5 025 ms against
 * 1 005 100 ms renditions. `decodedMs - renditionMs` is NEGATIVE there, roughly
 * minus a million, so the shortfall test could not fire and did not. The one
 * thing that caught it was `analyze` summing its segment reports — i.e. the
 * guard was, once again, an argument made per commit rather than a check made
 * per asset. This is the check.
 *
 * ASYMMETRIC, because the two directions have different benign causes.
 *
 * The overrun is NOT the handful of milliseconds of encoder padding it was
 * previously described as. Driving the real chain over a duration sweep
 * (4000 ms to 15 678 ms, 14 ms apart) shows the rendition's container duration
 * is exactly the decoded length ROUNDED UP TO A WHOLE 100 ms:
 *
 *   decoded 4000 ms -> m4a 4000 ms (+0)      decoded 4013 -> 4100 (+87)
 *   decoded 4027    -> 4100      (+73)       decoded 4097 -> 4100  (+3)
 *   decoded 9999    -> 10 000    (+1)        decoded 12 345 -> 12 400 (+55)
 *
 * That is `loudnorm`'s frame: it processes in `sample_rate / 10` blocks and
 * pads the final partial one. So the structural worst is
 *
 *   < 100 ms   loudnorm's final-frame padding
 *   +  6.5 ms  Ogg/Opus pre-skip and end padding (the opus leg runs exactly
 *              this much above the aac leg on every fixture measured)
 *   +  0.479 ms the cap-rounding below
 *   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   < 107 ms
 *
 * and the worst OBSERVED across the whole fixture corpus is 101 ms
 * (`overCapTruncated`, opus). 250 ms is 2.3x the structural worst. Note this is
 * the number to fix if `loudnorm` is ever replaced or its two-pass form adopted
 * — it is a property of that filter, not of the encoders.
 *
 * The padding is TRAILING, not leading, which is what makes it safe to allow at
 * all: an impulse test (transients in the first and last millisecond of a
 * 4013 ms source) finds them at output samples 0 and 192 625 against input
 * positions 0 and 192 576 — no shift. Phase 2's `loopEnd = durationSamples`
 * therefore still lands on real content, with the padding beyond it.
 *
 * The 0.479 ms is real and covered deliberately rather than absorbed by a round
 * number. `assertDecodedUsable` compares `Math.round(samples / 48)` against the
 * cap, so the largest sample count it accepts is 86 400 023 — 23 samples past
 * the 86 400 000 the render bound then cuts at. The recorded `durationSamples`
 * can therefore sit up to 23 samples ahead of what the renditions hold.
 *
 * And 250 ms still catches the thing it is for by four orders of magnitude: the
 * round 6 divergence was a 1 000 075 ms overrun.

 * partially written output, a full disk, a muxer that gave up mid-file. That is
 * the failure a `ready` asset must never be published with, because the row
 * would then carry a `durationSamples` phase 2 loops on that the rendition
 * cannot honour.
 *
 * This is also the one runtime check standing behind the claim that a duration
 * measured by `analyze` cannot diverge from the renditions a LATER ffmpeg
 * invocation produced. The argument for why they agree is in `processAsset`;
 * this is what makes a violation of it a failed asset rather than a wrong row.
 *
 * TWO-SIDED, and that is the whole point of it. It was one-sided until now,
 * testing only `decodedMs - renditionMs`, while the divergence it was cited as
 * preventing — round 6's `ready` row recording 5 025 ms against 1 005 100 ms of
 * renditions — is the other sign. The comment in `processAsset` claimed this
 * function made such a row impossible; it did not, and nothing did. See
 * `MAX_RENDITION_OVERRUN_MS` for why the two allowances differ.
 *
 * `segments` is `analyze`'s count of filter-graph segments, used to EXPLAIN a
 * shortfall. More than one means the source changes sample rate, sample format
 * or channel layout partway through, which makes ffmpeg rebuild the filter
 * graph — discarding whatever `loudnorm` was holding in its 3-second lookahead.
 * `assertDecodedUsable` now refuses such a source before either encoder runs,
 * so this branch is a backstop rather than the primary rejection; it stays
 * because the explanation is worth having if the earlier check is ever relaxed,
 * and because "the rendition is incomplete" alone tells the owner nothing they
 * can act on.
 *
 * NOTE what this deliberately does NOT do: it does not detect a truncated
 * SOURCE. It cannot. Detecting that means trusting the container header, and
 * for the format truncation is most common in — MP3 — the header duration is an
 * extrapolation that over-reports honest files by up to 8.2x (measured). The
 * harm A10 actually described was a `ready` row whose recorded duration came
 * from that header while its audio did not; that is closed at the source, by
 * `durationMs`/`durationSamples` both coming from `analyze()`. A half-
 * transferred MP3 now publishes as a shorter asset with an honest duration,
 * which the owner can see and re-upload, rather than as a permanent rejection
 * that ordinary music also trips.

/**
 * Terminal outcome for a FAILED once-variant run — and the fix for a Task 18
 * review Critical: `markFailed` must NEVER be called for a once-variant job.
 * Reusing the row's single status field for a second job type (the design
 * doc's own accepted trade-off) means `status: 'failed'` describes the WHOLE
 * row, not just the once job — a once-variant that is over-cap, silent, or
 * otherwise permanently unusable would set `permanentFailure: true` on a
 * fully-transcoded, previously-`ready` music asset, and `retryAudioAsset`
 * refuses rows carrying that flag. There is no path back to `ready` from
 * there: a wrong second file bricks a working asset on every board,
 * permanently, with delete-and-re-upload as the only remedy.
 *
 * Instead: the row goes straight back to `ready`/`main` — a fully playable
 * asset, exactly as it was before the attach — and the reason is recorded in
 * `onceLastError`, a field dedicated to the once job so it can never be
 * confused with `lastError` (which describes the MAIN pipeline and must stay
 * whatever it already was). `onceSourceKey` is cleared: nothing will ever
 * download it again once `variant` is back to `'main'`, and clearing the
 * reference is what lets the orphan scanner (`audio-cleanup.ts`) reclaim the
 * object instead of it being invisibly kept "in use" forever.
 *
 * This is reached from BOTH terminal once-variant paths in `processAsset`'s
 * catch block — a `PermanentError` (over-cap, silent, incomplete rendition,
 * ...) and a transient failure that exhausted `MAX_ATTEMPTS` — because both
 * are "this once job cannot succeed right now," and neither may ever read as
 * "this asset is broken."

      //
      // So the worst measured is 46.8 MB, 1.6x the number this comment used to
      // give, and it is REACHABLE FROM AN ACCEPTED SOURCE: the same five-tone
      // signal pre-encoded as a 128 kbit/s MP3 is 28.8 MB — comfortably inside
