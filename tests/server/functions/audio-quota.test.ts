 * "the five fields" — if `getUserStorageUsage` used a wrong field name, a
 * missing `$ifNull` guard, or summed the wrong count of terms, this
 * interpreter would compute the wrong number from the SAME pipeline object
 * the implementation built, and the assertion on the total would fail. A
 * test that instead hard-coded "sum these five named fields" would pass even
 * if the implementation's pipeline asked Mongo for different fields, because
 * nothing would ever cross-check the pipeline against the fixture.
