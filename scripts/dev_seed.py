"""
Build the dev seed: 3 test campaigns, each with sessions, characters, and a
generated placeholder SVG image.

This script builds documents; it does not write to a database. It records every
document, in order and with its id already assigned, into a plan file that
`scripts/seed/cli.ts` persists — routing each collection to the graph, or to
MongoDB for subsystems that have not moved yet. Keeping persistence in one place
means each subsystem's move changes a route, not this file.

Run through `npm run dev:seed`, which creates the game master and player accounts
in the graph and passes their ids (CARTYX_SEED_GM_ID, CARTYX_SEED_PLAYERS) and the
plan path (CARTYX_SEED_PLAN).

Images are still produced here (local public/uploads/, or R2 when the CDN is
configured), because that is file handling rather than persistence.

Safety: refuses to run if NODE_ENV is "production"; the CLI guards the targets.

    """Return Quest docs for the rich campaign, matching Quest.ts exactly.

    Exercises the full model: a public ACTIVE main quest with a character
    giver, multi-kind links (character/location/organization), and linked
    events; a public COMPLETED side quest; a public ON_HOLD personal quest
    with a player giver and a player-kind link; a GM-only PRIVATE quest with
    an organization giver, private link/event notes, and a private-info-only
    linked event; and a SUB-QUEST whose parentQuestId points at the main
    quest's _id (generated up front so it can be referenced before insertion).

    Arguments
    ---------
    character_by_name : dict mapping "First Last" → Character _id (built by
                        the caller from defn["characters"], same as the
                        membership builder uses).
    player_doc_ids    : list of Player document _ids.
    org_ids           : dict mapping org key (build_organization_docs) → _id.
    location_ids      : dict mapping location name → _id.
    event_ids         : dict mapping event title (build_event_docs) → _id.

    NOTE ON PRIVACY: resolveEvents (app/server/functions/quests.ts) drops a
    quest's event link entirely for a non-GM viewer if the linked Event's own
    isPublic flag is false — so a public quest must only link to public
    Events, or a non-GM reader will simply see fewer event links than a GM
    does. Here, only public quests link to public Events; the private
    quest's event link points at a private Event, which is doubly safe
    because the whole quest doc — and therefore its events array — is also
    filtered out for non-GM/non-creator viewers before that join ever runs.
