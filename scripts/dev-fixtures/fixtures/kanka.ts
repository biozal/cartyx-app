/**
 * `kanka` fixture — pulls a campaign world from the user's Kanka account
 * (https://kanka.io) into the local dev DB.
 *
 * Status: STUB. Throws "not implemented" with a clear message and prints
 * the integration contract so the next implementer knows what to wire up.
 *
 * Planned integration shape:
 *   - Reads KANKA_TOKEN (API token from Kanka account settings) and
 *     KANKA_CAMPAIGN_ID (the source Kanka campaign id) from .env.
 *   - Walks Kanka's REST API (https://app.kanka.io/api-docs):
 *       /1.0/campaigns/{id}            → name, description
 *       /1.0/campaigns/{id}/locations  → Cartyx Location docs
 *       /1.0/campaigns/{id}/characters → Cartyx Character docs
 *       /1.0/campaigns/{id}/notes      → optional, map to Cartyx Notes
 *   - Inserts into the dev DB with `metadata.managedBy = scripts/dev-fixtures`
 *     and `metadata.fixtureName = 'kanka'` so the destroyer can clean up.
 *   - Best-effort image import: Kanka entity images live at predictable
 *     URLs; either rehost into R2 or store the Kanka URL directly on the
 *     Cartyx doc.
 *
 * Rate limiting: Kanka API is 30 req/min for free accounts (90/min for
 * subscribers). The walker needs a token bucket.
