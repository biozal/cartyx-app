/**
 * Stand-in for every `~/server/**` module in Storybook.
 *
 * Hooks declare server functions as
 *   createServerFn(...).handler(async () => {
 *     const { thing } = await import('~/server/functions/…')
 *   })
 * and a bundler follows that dynamic import even though a story never executes
 * it — dragging the graph and CQL drivers and `@sentry/node-core` into a
 * browser bundle. In the real app the TanStack Start plugin strips server-fn
 * bodies before that can happen, but Storybook deliberately does not run that
 * plugin (see .storybook/vite.config.ts), so the server layer is aliased here.
 *
 * Calling anything here means a story tried to reach the database, which
 * Storybook can never satisfy — so each export throws a message that names
 * itself rather than failing as `undefined is not a function`.
 *
 * The named exports below are the ones CLIENT code imports statically (a
 * dynamic `await import()` destructures the namespace at runtime and needs no
 * static export). If a new static client→server import appears, this build
 * fails with `"<name>" is not exported by …` — a loud, self-describing failure.
 * Add the name here when that happens.
