/**
 * Stand-in for `@tanstack/react-start` in Storybook.
 *
 * The real module reaches `@tanstack/start-storage-context`, which imports
 * `node:async_hooks` — unresolvable in a browser bundle, and fatal to the
 * preview build ("AsyncLocalStorage is not exported by __vite-browser-external").
 * In the app the Start vite plugin handles this; Storybook deliberately does not
 * run that plugin (see .storybook/vite.config.ts).
 *
 * Only `createServerFn` and `createMiddleware` are imported anywhere in `app/`,
 * and both exist purely to define server endpoints — so the builder chain is
 * reproduced here and the resulting endpoint throws a clear message if a story
 * ever calls it. Pair this with the `~/server/**` alias, which keeps the handler
 * bodies (and therefore the data drivers) out of the bundle entirely.
