# Running Cartyx Locally

Two ways to run the stack against Docker Desktop:

| Path               | Use when                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **docker-compose** | You want the web app + realtime service running together, no Kubernetes. Fastest.                                                                                                          |
| **kind**           | You want to test the real Kubernetes manifests, probes, and the Helm chart before they hit a real cluster. Deploys the full app chart (web + realtime) — the same manifests as production. |

The docker-compose path runs `web` (built from the repo-root
`Dockerfile.web`, served on host port **3100**) and `realtime` (built from
`realtime/Dockerfile`, served on host port **1999**, unchanged from before). The `web`
container depends on `realtime` passing its healthcheck before it starts. Cassandra
and JanusGraph run alongside them with persistent storage, TLS and authentication.
The audio worker is available through `--profile audio`; it consumes the queue
configured in `.env`, so use development credentials. The kind path deploys the
application chart and a separate `cartyx-data` chart: web on host port **3200**,
realtime on **1999**.

The database chart, Compose definitions, configuration, and operations tools live
in the separate `cartyx-infrastructure` repository. Check out both repositories
beside each other, with the infrastructure changes present:

```text
Developer/
  cartyx-app/
  cartyx-infrastructure/
```

For another location, export `CARTYX_INFRASTRUCTURE_DIR` as an **absolute path**
in your shell; both the npm commands and Compose use it. The npm wrapper does
not load this setting from `.env`. Land the infrastructure changes before the
app integration so a fresh checkout can find these files.

Initialize the local data credentials before the first full-stack Compose run:

```bash
npm run db:tools
npm run db:up
npm run db:smoke -- seed
npm run db:smoke
```

`npm run dev` also starts/waits for the Docker database services. `npm run db:down`
stops them without deleting data. Application subsystems still use MongoDB during
this infrastructure phase. See the [data infrastructure runbook](https://github.com/biozal/cartyx-infrastructure/blob/main/deploy/charts/cartyx-data/README.md)
for Kubernetes, credentials, backups and restore rehearsals.

Application secrets come from the app repo-root `.env`; database credentials live
in `cartyx-infrastructure/.local/data/local`. For docker-compose specifically,
you must run the command from the **repo root** with `--env-file .env` so the
`VITE_PUBLIC_*` build args (feature flags) interpolate into the `web`
image at build time — running it any other way, or omitting `--env-file .env`, builds
`web` with those flags unset.

`npm run e2e:container` is the scripted way to bring this stack up, run the
Playwright suite against it, and tear it down.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop**, running.
- For the kind path: `kind`, `kubectl`, `helm`:
  ```bash
  brew install kind kubectl helm
  ```

## Environment

Both paths read the repo-root `.env`. Two variables matter:

- **`SESSION_SECRET` (required)** — must be **identical** to the value the web app
  signs party tokens with. If it differs, every WebSocket connection is rejected
  with `401`. Copy it from the same `.env` the app uses.
- **`MONGODB_URI`** — required for the kind path (the web app can't pass `/readyz`
  without it) and recommended for compose. Point it at a **dedicated database in the
  URI path** so it stays out of the app's data:
  ```
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://USER:PASS@cluster.mongodb.net/cartyx_local
  ```
  The service uses whatever database the URI names.

## Path A — docker-compose

Run from the repo root:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/local/compose.yaml up --build
```

Verify in another terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3100/healthz   # -> {"status":"ok"}
curl http://localhost:1999/healthz   # -> ok
```

Stop:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/local/compose.yaml down
```

## Path B — kind

```bash
./deploy/local/deploy-kind.sh          # up (default)
```

This creates a single-node kind cluster `cartyx-local` (host `1999` → realtime NodePort
`30199`, host `3200` → web NodePort `30320`), builds both images, loads them into the
cluster, deploys the `cartyx` Helm chart with your `.env` secrets, and waits until web
and realtime answer their health endpoints.

Tear down (deletes the cluster):

```bash
./deploy/local/deploy-kind.sh down
```

## Connect the web app

In the docker-compose path, the `web` service is already wired to the composed
`realtime` service via `localhost:1999` (the host port mapping), so no extra
configuration is needed — just open `http://localhost:3100`.

If instead you're running the web app outside of compose (e.g. `npm run dev`) against
a realtime service from either path, the realtime service is reachable at
`localhost:1999`, which is already the web app's default
(`VITE_PUBLIC_PARTYKIT_HOST=localhost:1999`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open a campaign session in two browser windows and do a dice roll — it should relay
between them, and chat history should return on reload (when `MONGODB_URI` is set).

## Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:3100/healthz            # -> {"status":"ok"} (200, web, docker-compose only)
curl http://localhost:3200/healthz            # -> {"status":"ok"} (200, web, kind only)
curl http://localhost:1999/healthz            # -> ok (200, realtime, both paths)
```

For an authenticated WebSocket smoke test you need a valid party token signed with the
same `SESSION_SECRET`; the easiest full check is the two-browser flow above.

## Teardown

- compose: `docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/local/compose.yaml down`
- kind: `./deploy/local/deploy-kind.sh down`
